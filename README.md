# My Portfolio-Milestone Project One
My Portfolio-Milestone Project One

This is a Portfolio that IÂ´ve created as my first project of the Frontend Developer Course. My Portfolio works as a showroom for my Art work and links it to the brand "UglyducksDesign" which is at the moment a fictional online shop. Each page contains social media links that users can access to get to know more about my work.

# UX
This webpage is for current and potential clients interested in getting to know me better and learn more about Stained Glass, were they can find a brief explanation of the technique and its origins.
I've chosen to style my website in a way that would really bring out the colours of the art work exhibited in the pictures. A black background does exactly that, pulls the users attention to the bright and vivid colours of the Stained Glass and at the same time it allows for some eye confort to browse through each pages different sections.

# User Stories
As a potential client I want to know more about the artist and her story so that I can feel more confident and trust in her skills.
As the designer I want clients to be able to match their expectations to my work and be abble to easily contact me and feel free to enquire about potencial projects.
As Stained Glass fan I want to browse through the images and find inspiration for a piece that would look amazing in my house.
As an event organiser I want to know more about the designer and her work so that I can decide whether to invite her to take part in an upcoming Crafts Fair.

# Wireframes

My wireframes helped as an inicial plan of how I would like my Portfolio to look like in terms of
its structure, I have choosen not too include to much detail, instead I have focused more on the importance of building a responsive website. 
With that in mind, I have created two wireframes per page, one for larger 
screens and another one for smaller screens.
I drew my wireframes using Balsamiq and the links to the files are below:

## Features

### Existing Features

#### All Pages

- **Navigation links** - Located in the navigation bar, allows users to navigate around my website by clicking each navigation link, which redirects them to the relevant webpage. Screen sizes above 576px.

Only visible in screen sizes under 576px.
- **Social media links** - These links are located in the Footer of all my website pages (Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn). It makes it easy for users to find and access different relevant social media pages and as it opens on a different tab it avoids loosing track of the page they were inicially. 

#### All Pages (exluding index.html)

- **Navbar clickable logo** - Users can go back to home page from all the other pages, this is especially useful
in smaller screens when the navigation links are hidden under the hamburger button.

- **Carousel with indicators and controls** - The carousel contains ten pictures of Template designing, Painting and Stained Glass finished projects, which slide automatically. Alternatively, users can use the controls to manually slide forwards or backwards through the images. The indicators allow users to see which image of the series they are viewing.
- **Social media link** - A link to the Instagram shop. The link is functional but in reality "UglyducksDesign Shop" is not active at the moment.
#### about.html

#### contact.html

- **Contact form with submit button** - Allows users to put their questions, enquire about the services offered or potentially discuss a project. The form requires the users to fill in their details in all three boxes otherwise it will not submit their message.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

I used my user stories and documented each of the steps that each user would need to accomplish what they have stated. Below is the link to the document that contains this information:

- [Testing User Stories](https://github.com/Susafp/Portfolio-Milestone-Project-One/blob/b2ef0f7facfd9043d68736c5e58e499d45cd8433/Testing%20Users%20Stories/Testing%20Users%20Stories.pdf)

### Responsive Testing

I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.

To test my whole website, I went through each page, feature by feature, and documented the results on a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet also documents any responsive features and confirms that they work and appear as intended on different screen sizes. The link to the spreadsheet it below:

- [Testing Checklist](https://github.com/hebs87/monkees-milestone-project-one/blob/master/testing-documents/testing-checklist.pdf)

### HTML and CSS Validation

I used the [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code.

I used the [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.

### Interesting Bugs or Problems

- **Burger icon** - The burger icon wasn't appearing once the fullscreen overlay menu was triggered. The reason for this is that the header in which the burger icon was in had a lower z-index than the overlay menu. To fix the issue, I gave the header a higher z-index value than the overlay menu.
- **Burger icon when overlay menu is triggered** - As the header (including the burger icon) is part of the page, it disappears when the user scrolls down while the overlay menu is triggered. The user then has to scroll back to the top of the page for the burger icon to reappear while the overlay menu is triggered. This is another constraint, and I will fix this bug when I learn JavaScript, so that the header remains fixed, only when the overlay menu is triggered.
- **Band card images** - The images automatically take up 100% of the card width, so they appear stretched. I have tried to make the images take up less of the card width, but this throws the alignment out, and it doesn't look as tidy with the scroll bars. This is a constraint and I've decided to leave the images as they are.
- **'dates' attribute** - For the discography timeline, I used the sample code from the code used within the Resume mini project. The sample code used the `dates` attribute. However, the [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) stated that this was invalid. When I looked on Slack, I saw that another student had the same issue, and the advice they received was to use the `data-year` attribute instead. I tried this and it resolved the issue.
- **'Submit' button on *Book Us* form** - Once I entered the information and submitted the form, the form kept routing me through to the index.html page. After speaking with my mentor, he asked me to check the value of the `action` attribute of the `<form>` element. The issue was that the value I was using was `action="/"`. Once I changed this to `action="contact.html"` the issue was resolved.
- **'Submit' button on *Book Us* form** - Once I entered the information and submitted the form, I kept getting a '405 Not Allowed' error message, but this was only happening in the live environment and not the testing environment. I posted this in the Slack community and was given the advice to change the `method` value to `get` instead of `post`. This resolved the error.

## Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Loaded the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace.
2. Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
3. Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the `git add .` command.
4. Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m "Initial commit"` command.
5. Created a new repository in GitHub called 'monkees-milestone-project-one'.
6. Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace:

    ```git remote add origin https://github.com/hebs87/monkees-milestone-project-one.git```

    ```git push -u origin master```

7. Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.
8. Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.
9. Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.
10. Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
