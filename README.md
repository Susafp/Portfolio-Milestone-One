# My Portfolio-Milestone Project One
My Portfolio-Milestone Project One

This is a Portfolio that IÂ´ve created as my first project of the Frontend Developer Course. My Portfolio works as a showroom for my Art work and links it to the brand "UglyducksDesign" which is at the moment a fictional online shop. Each page contains social media links that users can access to get to know more about my work.

# UX
This webpage is for current and potential clients interested in getting to know me better and learn more about Stained Glass, were they can find a brief explanation of the technique and its origins.
I've chosen to style my website in a way that would really bring out the colours of the art work exhibited in the pictures. A black background does exactly that, pulls the users attention to the bright and vivid colours of the Stained Glass and at the same time it allows for some eye confort to browse through each pages different sections.

# User Stories
As a potential client I want to know more about the artist and her story so that I can feel more confident and trust in her skills.
As the designer I want clients to be able to match their expectations to my work and be abble to easily contact me and feel free to enquire about potencial projects.
As Stained Glass fan I want to browse through the images and find inspiration for a piece that would look amazing in my house.
As an event organiser I want to know more about the designer and her work so that I can decide whether to invite her to take part in an upcoming Crafts Fair.

# Wireframes
I drew my wireframes using Balsamiq. I have done two wireframes for each page to show my consideration of how to make my website responsive. The links to the files are below:

index.html (xl and sm)
index.html (md, lg and xl)
band.html (xl and sm)
band.html (md, lg and xl)
music.html (xl and sm)
music.html (md, lg and xl)
tickets.html (xl and sm)
tickets.html (md, lg and xl)
contact.html (xl and sm)
contact.html (md, lg and xl)
There are some differences between my wireframes and my final website. This was due to visual preferences and feedback received from other users who tested my website.
